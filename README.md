# Facade Pattern

### About
In these repositories, some design patterns are implemented to a mini game system for self education. They may not be suited to use in an actual game (directly anyway). However, it is good to have some examples underhand to take reference. And even if anyone wants to use them, you are welcome.

### Definition
**_Facade pattern_**, provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

### Description
We have worked hard and developed our own physics engine, audio engine, particle system and so on. Now, we want to use these systems and enrich our combat system. First, scene will be opened, then background music will start, characters will be placed, camera will move around characters and physics engine will be enabled.
